# Matrix Voicerooms

This project aims to create a voice rooms solution integrated in the Matrix ecosystem. This solution will be conceptualized and programmed by CEDILLE (open-source student club at École de Technologie Supérieure) with the help of the opensource community. The idea is not to create a specefic client with audio support, but to create a pluggable solution usable by clients who wants to integrate it.

The project will use 2 main components:

1. Voice Server: https://github.com/ClubCedille/matrix-voicerooms-server
2. Client SDKs (only NPM for now): https://github.com/ClubCedille/matrix-voicerooms-npm

This repository contains all the planification documentation, wikis and constitute the entry point for this project.
